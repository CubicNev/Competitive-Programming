# Competitive-Programming 🧠

This repository contains some algorithmic problems with an efficient aproach, using multiple programming languages to increase my skills.

## Structure 🗃️

The main idea is to go through multiple programming topics to practice, also, gather as many problems as possible with its explanation and solution. Therefore we have:

- **Problems 📝💻:** Description file in Markdown and solution code in different programming languages (Currently only C++)
- **Templates 🧩:** Templates for all kinds use cases.
- **Theory 📚:** Compilation of notes to better understanding of the Problems. Look into [Table of contents](./Theory/index.md) for more information.

## Extra info 🛠️

This repository is a combination of english and spanish stuff.
